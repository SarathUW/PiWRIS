# Library Comparison: Pandas, Polars, and Modin

---

## **Pandas**

- **GitHub Metrics**: ⭐ 43k+ stars, 3,000+ contributors
  - Extensive community, fast pull requests.
  
- **Functionality & Data Types**:
  - Highly versatile with DataFrame and Series.
  - Supports a broad range of operations: merging, reshaping, time-series, and categorical data.

- **Data Compatibility & Supplement Libraries**:
  - Vast ecosystem: *GeoPandas* for vector spatial data, *Dask* for parallel processing, and many others.

- **Performance & Efficiency**:
  - Ideal for small-to-medium datasets.
  - No native parallel processing, so less efficient for larger data.

- **Community & Documentation**:
  - Large community, comprehensive documentation, and tutorials.
  
- **Best For**: General-purpose data manipulation, small-to-medium datasets.

## **Modin**

- **GitHub Metrics**: ⭐ 10k stars, 134 contributors
  - Smaller community but dedicated to scaling pandas-like operations.

- **Functionality & Data Types**:
  - Mirrors pandas API, allowing familiar operations with parallelism.
  - Handles larger-than-memory datasets with distributed computing across cores and nodes.

- **Data Compatibility & Supplement Libraries**:
  - Works with pandas-compatible libraries like *GeoPandas* and theoretically supports others through modin.geopandas.

- **Performance & Efficiency**:
  - Leverages parallel processing to scale pandas workflows.
  - Significant speed improvements for larger datasets; however, parallelization overhead can slow smaller data.

- **Community & Documentation**:
  - Smaller community, but pandas documentation can be applied directly due to API similarity.

- **Best For**: Scaling pandas workflows, handling larger datasets with parallel processing.

## **Polars**

- **GitHub Metrics**: ⭐ 30k stars, 500+ contributors
  - Rapidly growing, gaining popularity for speed and efficiency.

- **Functionality & Data Types**:
  - Provides DataFrame-like structures with a SQL-like query syntax.
  - Built in Rust, highly efficient for columnar data and large-scale datasets.

- **Data Compatibility & Supplement Libraries**:
  - Arrow-compatible (pyArrow), making it highly interoperable with other tools.
  - *GeoPolars* for geographic data processing with high performance.

- **Performance & Efficiency**:
  - Rust backend and lazy evaluation make it 10x faster than pandas on large data.
  - Optimized for high-speed, large-scale data processing.

- **Community & Documentation**:
  - Growing community with improving documentation.
  
- **Best For**: Large datasets, high-speed operations, optimized workflows.
